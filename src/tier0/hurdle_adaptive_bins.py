"""Hurdle + value-respecting adaptive binning for null stratification keys.

Replaces ``_assign_rank_bins`` for the hurdle+adaptive strategies: rank
binning with positional tie-breaking can split equal keys into different
strata (the Entrez-ID-block artifact behind the vacuous Tier 0 promiscuity
result -- see docs/tasks/capacity-hurdle-adaptive-null/design.md). Here
strata are contiguous in key value, equal keys always share a stratum, and
key == 0 (an exact exchangeability class for both first-hop degree and
leave-target-out capacity) is isolated as its own hurdle stratum.
